        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Fluids, in particular liquids such as water, are responsible for many visually rich phenomena, and simulating
            them has been an area of long-standing interest and challenge in computer graphics. This final project
            focuses on the implementation of a particle-based fluid simulation and rendering system. The simulation
            involves computing and updating particles' positions, velocity, and forces by tracking pressure and
            viscosity. We utilized kernel functions, such as Poly6 and Spiky kernels, and the SPH algorithm to estimate
            each particle' state at each time frame. We also re-index the particle's memory position to increase cache
            efficiency. The rendering aspect offers four modes: particle rendering, wireframe/mesh rendering, Phong
            rendering, and MirrorPhong rendering. The fluid surface rendering is achieved through the marching cubes
            algorithm, which outputs a polygonal 3D surface mesh. This project is especially significant in providing
            insights into fast particle simulation and rendering techniques. Realistic water rendering has potential
            applications in gaming, engineering, and graphics research. </p>

        <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
        <p>We used particle-based fluid simulation, and we split the problem into two main parts: simulation and
            rendering. Simulation refers to the physical simulation of each fluid particle, which includes computing and
            updating particles' positions, velocity, and forces by tracking pressure, viscosity, and vorticity.
            Rendering refers to the visual rendering in GUI, which supports multiple modes including particle rendering,
            wireframe/mesh rendering, and Phong rendering. Thus, we will separate the discussion of our technical
            approach into two subsections, one for simulation and the other for rendering.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Simulation:</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">For our implementation, the cloth simulator (project 4) codebase served as a
            convenient starting point since we are implementing a particle-based Lagragian fluid simulation. We
            implemented the Fluid class to define fluids, which defines a fluid's behavior under the forces of gravity,
            pressure, and viscosity. Similar to how Cloth objects save a list of PointMasses, our Fluid objects holds a
            list of Particles that each represent a blob of liquid, recording information of their density, pressure,
            location, velocity, and forces.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Finding Neighbors:</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">At the beginning of each timestep, we calculate the neighbors of each particle. To do
            this, we divide the space into cells of dimensions (R * R * R), and perform spatial hashing. We first build
            the spatial map using the hash value of the coordinates of the cell that each particle is contained in. Then
            for each particle, we find its neighbors (defined by having distance < R and not being the particle itself)
                by checking the neighboring 27 cells (including the cell it resides in). These neighboring particles are
                recorded within a vector<Particles *> that is used for later calculations within this timestep.
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Using Kernel functions:</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">For the following value updates, we will use kernel functions W to estimation. These
            kernel functions use the distance of particles to provide a weight for how influential a particle should be
            towards another particle. In our simulation, we followed Muller et al. (2003) and used three different
            kernel functions: Poly6 kernel for density estimation, Spiky kernel for gradient, and another kernel for
            laplacien estimations.</p>
        <p>\[\begin{aligned}
            W_{poly6}(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j, R) &amp;=
            \begin{cases}
            \frac{315}{64 \pi R^9} (R^2 - \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\|^2)^3 &amp; \text{if } \|\mathbf{x}_i -
            \mathbf{x}_j\| \leq R \\
            0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
            \end{cases}
            \end{aligned}\]</p>
        <p>\[\begin{aligned}
            \nabla W_{spiky}(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j, R) &amp;=
            \begin{cases}
            -\frac{45 (R - \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\|)^2}{\pi R^6 \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\|} * (\mathbf{x}_i
            - \mathbf{x}_j) &amp; \text{if } \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\| \leq R \\
            0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
            \end{cases}
            \end{aligned}\]</p>
        <p>\[\begin{aligned}
            \nabla^2 W(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j, R) &amp;=
            \begin{cases}
            \frac{45* (R - \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\|)}{\pi R^6} &amp; \text{if } \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\|
            \leq R \\
            0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
            \end{cases}
            \end{aligned}\]</p>
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Updating density and calculating pressure:</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">Using the neighborhood arrays, we update i, the density of each particle. Here we use
            the standard SPH density estimator. Note that we are explicitly including the first term since the particle
            itself should contribute towards the density:<br>
            \[\rho_i=m_iW(x_i-x_i,R)+\sum_{j} m_j*W(x_i-x_j,R)\] <br>
            We can then calculate the pressure at each particle using this method suggested by Muller et al (2003): <br>
            \[p_i = k(\rho_i-\rho_o)\]
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Calculating forces:</h3>
        <p>With the pressure and density calculated for each particle, we can now calculate the pressure forces and
            viscosity forces acting on each particle. For reference, we use the pressure force estimator suggested in
            the SPH STAR report (2014) and the viscosity estimator suggested in Muller et al (2003). Note that for both
            these forces, we do not include the particle itself since the particle should not contribute to forces on
            itself.</p>
        <ul>
            \[f_{pressure} = m_i * \sum_{j} m_j * (\frac{p_i}{\rho_i ^ 2} + \frac{p_j}{\rho_j^2}) * \Delta W(x_i - x_j,
            R)\]
            \[f_{viscosity} = m_i * \sum_{j} m_j * (\frac{v_j-v_i}{\rho_j}) * \Delta^2 W(x_i - x_j, R)\]
            \[f_{ext} = m_i * g\]
        </ul>
        <p>The total force would be:
            \[f_{total} = f_{pressure} + f_{viscosity} + f_{ext}\]</p>
        <p>This force provides us with an acceleration, which allows us to perform forward integration. Note that the
            instability issue of forward integration is addressed by viscosity acting as a damping force:</p>
        <ul>
            \[\ddot{x}_n = \frac{f_n}{m}\]
            \[\dot{x}_{n+1} = \dot{x}_n + \ddot{x}_n \Delta t\]
            \[x_{n+1} = x_n + \dot{x}_n \Delta t\]
        </ul>
        <p>Lastly, we check for particles that cross barriers. If a particle goes through a plane, we move it to the
            correct side and adjust its velocity by adding a component to the direction of the plane’s normal vector
            with a magnitude proportional to its original velocity in that direction.</p>



        <h3>Adjustments:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For collision checks, we initially only fixed the location of the crossing particle to be on the correct
                side of the plane. This resulted in the behavior where particles that next to the planes often end up
                "stuck" to the wall (and even more so on corners). This happened because the velocity of the particle
                was still making the particle pass through the plane at each timestep, and it was the position fix that
                created the illusion that the particle isn't moving in that direction. To fix this, we modeled the
                particle-plane collisions as inelastic collisions, adding the plane's normal vector (scaled by the
                particle's velocity in this direction) to the particle's velocity. This helps the particles break away
                from corners and planes, which looks alot more realistic. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rendering</h2>
        <h3>Particle Rendering:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Since we followed the particle-based approach for fluid simulation, the first and most simple rendering
                approach we support is particle rendering. In our data structure design, fluid keeps track of a list of
                all particles, and each particle stores its current position. To render the fluid as particles, we
                simply upload the position of all particles to the shader, and draw the particles as GL_POINTS. We also
                set the point size on screen to make visualization clearer.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Wireframe, Phong, and MirrorPhong Rendering Using Marching Cubes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To support more realistic fluid surface rendering, we build a mesh over the fluid body using the
                marching cubes approach suggested by [Fleck 2008]. This approach utilizes an underlying voxel grid and
                outputs a polygonal 3D surface mesh. The basic idea is that we first build a 3D voxel grid over the
                scene. Then for each cube of the 3D grid, we calculate the intersection points with the cube by the
                fluid. We store the resulting triangles and normals into the input list for the shaders.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the surface intersection, we need to decide whether each vertex of the cube is inside or outside of
                the fluid, and then interpolate between vertices to find intersection points. To do this, we come up
                with a density function that computes the distance from a given 3D position to the closest particle. For
                each cube, we use this density function to compute a value for each of its vertices, and compare them to
                a predefined isovalue. A vertex value less than the isovalue means that the vertex lies within the
                fluid, and vice versa. For each edge, if one vertex is outside the fluid and the other is inside, then
                the edge has a cut. According to the configuration of which vertex (vertices) lies within the fluid, we
                check a prebuilt lookup table for one of the fifteen ways to cut the cube, as listed in Figure 1. For
                each edge that is cut by the surface, we linearly interpolate between the isovalue and the vertex values
                to calculate the intersection point. We then connect each group of three intersection points to form
                triangles. The union of all triangles found this way form a mesh, which is an envelope, of the fluid
                body.

                        <img src="src/MC.png" align="middle" />

                    <td>
            </table>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To compute the vertex normals, we use the formula:
                $$N_x(i,j,k)=\frac{V(i+1,j,k)-V(i-1,j,k)}{\Delta d}$$
                $$N_y(i,j,k)=\frac{V(i,j+1,k)-V(i,j-1,k)}{\Delta d}$$
                $$N_z(i,j,k)=\frac{V(i,j,k+1)-V(i,j,k-1)}{\Delta d}$$
                Where N(i,j,k) is the cube vertex normal, V(i,j,k) is the density value at (i,j,k), and Delta d is the
                cube's side length.
            </li>


            <li>
                Finally, we export the list of triangles and the vertex normals to the wireframe shader and the Phong
                shader. We also built another shader called MirrorPhong which adds in some reflections sampled from a
                sky texture to the regular Phong result. This provides a more realistic fluid rendering effect.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the marching cubes implementation, we found the source code of marching cubes (including the lookup
                tables) from [Bourke 1994], but we needed to adapt the code to our data structure and algorithmic
                design. Additionally, we designed our own density function. We tried several different approaches,
                including counting the number of particles within a certain distance (and adjusting the distance
                parameter), computing the norm of an “average” vector to a few nearest surrounding particles, and
                computing the distance to the closest particle. We finally decided to go with the last approach because
                it could be implemented efficiently with the hash function for finding neighbors and it provides decent
                results. We also needed to adjust the grid size and the isovalue. After some experimentation, we found a
                combination of grid_size = 2 * particle_radius and isovalue = 3 * particle_radius gives the most natural
                rendering result.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Problems Encountered:</h3>
        <p>
            Since we build our project on top of project 4, we need to understand the workflow of the clothSimulator. At
            first we were not sure where to build the mesh for rendering, and how to pass the mesh to the shaders. By
            reading over the original main.cpp and clothSimulator.cpp, we understood where our fluid object should be
            initiated, how the scene was drawn to the GUI, and how different shaders are invoked. We also had problems
            setting the point size when rendering in particle mode, since we did not know that we needed to add and
            upload an additional uniform variable for point size. Another big issue we encountered was computing vertex
            normals. The mesh we built does not follow a halfedge data structure, and it is also very hard to find
            neighboring triangles given what we have since the mesh is a 3D polygon. We solved the problem by using the
            vertex normal formula we found in [Fleck 2008], which produces the desired result. We also had problems with
            C++ pointers and memory allocation, which we spent a lot of time debug using the Xcode debugger and print
            statements.
        </p>
        <h3>Lessons Learned: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Marching cubes algorithm as a mesh-building and rendering technique for fluid. </li>
            <li>Effects of different rendering techniques to run time: particle rendering is the quickest, while mesh
                rendering is slower due to mesh re-building at every timestep. </li>
            <li>Importance of vertex normal to smoothness of rendered image. </li>
        </ul>

                Tinna Liu & Yiwei Zhou:

                Worked collaboratively through Zoom sessions at all times. Built data structures including fluid,
                particle, cube (container), gridcell (for marching cubes). Implemented fluid initialization and marching
                cubes algorithm for fluid mesh, and tuned marching cubes parameters. Implemented fluidSimulator on top
                of clothSimulator (proj. 4) to export mesh data to shaders. Modified shader files to support various
                rendering methods. </li>
            <li>             Justin Shao:
                did research on particle based simulations, implemented simulation code under the SPH framework, helped
                optimize particle-boundary collisions, worked on tuning liquid parameters.
            </li>

                Jierui Xu:

                helped debug and clarify mathematical equations of the model; implemented re-index algorithm to improve
                cache efficiency; focused on parameter tuning and debugging of the whole model, changing rest density,
                viscosity constant, stiffness constant, and density search radius to generate more realistic rendering.
